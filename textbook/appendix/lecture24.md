**CS 161 Lecture Summary - March 31: Midterm Exam Review**

**Overview:**
This class session was a review for the upcoming midterm exam on Wednesday. The exam will be **30 multiple-choice questions** based on **Quizzes 1 and 2**. Students should bring **pencils** (preferably not pens) for the Scantron-based test. There will be **no notes, no computers**, and students will be asked to space out in the classroom.

---

### Format of Review:
The review was conducted by walking through both quizzes as a class. Dr. T read each question aloud, students voted on answers, and the correct answers were explained.

---

## Quiz 1 Topics Covered:

1. **Variable Assignment:**
   - Example: `A = 10` then `print(A + B)` requires B to be previously defined.

2. **Python Comments:**
   - Correct: `# This is a comment`
   - Other comment formats were shown from different languages (e.g., `/* */`, `--`, `//`).

3. **Print Function:**
   - Used to display output in the console.

4. **Calculating Averages:**
   - Example: `average = (A + B + C + D + E) / 5`

5. **Swapping Variables in Python:**
   - Example: `x, y = y, x` swaps the values of `x` and `y`.

6. **Variable Mutability:**
   - Variables in Python can be reassigned.
   - Constants are by convention written in **ALL_CAPS**.

7. **Declaring Variables:**
   - Python uses `x = 5`. Syntax like `x := 5` (walrus operator) or `x : int = 5` is not typical for beginners.

8. **Input and Eval:**
   - Use `eval(input(...))` to convert input from a string to an integer.

9. **Camel Case vs Snake Case:**
   - Python uses **snake_case** by convention, not camelCase.

10. **Extra discussion:**
    - Mention of the `statistics.mean()` function for calculating averages.

## Quiz 2 Topics Covered:

1. **Indentation in Python:**
   - Required for defining blocks of code.

2. **Elif Keyword:**
   - Short for "else if".

3. **While Loops:**
   - Run while the Boolean condition is `True`.

4. **Equality Comparison:**
   - `==` checks equality; `=` is for assignment.

5. **Loop Behavior:**
   - `while` loops continue as long as the condition is `True`.
   - `for` loops run a known number of times.

6. **Falsy Values:**
   - `0` is considered `False` in Boolean contexts.

7. **If Statements:**
   - Example: `if x > 2: print("yes") else: print("no")`

8. **Counting Loops:**
   - Example: `count = 0; while count < 3: print(count); count += 1`

9. **Boolean Expressions:**
   - Examples: `x > 10`, `x == 5`, etc.

10. **Infinite Loops:**
   - Example: `while True:` creates an infinite loop.

### Notes on the Midterm:
- Based on **quizzes**, not identical but **very similar**.
- **30 multiple-choice questions**.
- Bring a **pencil**.
- **No notes or electronic devices allowed**.
- Class will be seated with spacing between students.

### Office Hours:
Dr. T will be available for office hours from **3–5 PM today**. No appointment needed, just walk in.

---

### Final Motivation:
> "If you paid attention today, you should do fine on the exam."

Dr. T reminded students that they’ve already seen the types of questions to expect and encouraged them to study the quizzes in detail.

**Next Class (Wednesday):** Midterm exam.
**Friday:** Return to lecture content, starting the next major topic: **functions**.
