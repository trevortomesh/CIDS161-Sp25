### Assignment Overview: Lethal Caffeine Dose Calculator

#### Objective
The first assignment is designed to introduce basic Python concepts related to **input, calculation, and output**. Students will develop a program that calculates the lethal dose of caffeine based on user input regarding their weight.

#### Requirements
1. **Prompt the user** to enter their weight in pounds.
2. **Convert the weight** from pounds to kilograms.
   - Conversion factor: `1 pound = 0.453592 kg`
3. **Calculate the lethal dose** of caffeine using the formula:
   - `Lethal Dose = 150 mg * weight in kg`
4. **Output the following:**
   - Weight in pounds and kilograms
   - Estimated lethal dose in milligrams
   - Number of standard coffee cups (95 mg per cup) needed to reach this dose
5. **Documentation**
   - Describe the thought process, challenges, and solutions encountered while coding.
   - Explain any external resources or references used (e.g., ChatGPT, Stack Overflow).
6. **Include a Screenshot** of the program running with sample input/output.
7. **Submit as a PDF**, including:
   - Python code
   - Screenshot of the working program
   - Documentation write-up

### Writing About Your Code
As part of this course, you will need to **write about your code**—this means explaining what your program does in a way that anyone can understand. Being able to articulate coding decisions is an essential skill.

- Explain what your program does in simple terms.
- Discuss the **design choices** made (e.g., how you structured your code, why you wrote it a certain way).
- If you faced **challenges**, describe them and how you solved them.
- Cite any **external help or resources** used (ChatGPT, online documentation, tutors, etc.).

### Exceeding Expectations (Bonus Points)
Meeting all requirements will earn a **maximum of 95%**. To achieve an **A+ (100%)**, students must go beyond expectations. 

Some examples include:
- Allowing the user to input weight in **pounds or kilograms**.
- Displaying **lethal dose in terms of energy drinks or soda** instead of just coffee.
- Formatting the user interface for improved readability.
- Adding error handling (e.g., preventing negative weight input).
- Any other creative enhancements (explain what you did for the extra credit).

### Grading Breakdown
- **Input, Calculation, and Output:** 70%
- **Documentation:** 30%
- **Extra Credit (if applicable):** Up to 5%

### Submission Guidelines
- Convert the document (including code, output, and explanation) into **a single PDF**.
- Ensure all elements (code, documentation, and screenshot) are clearly included.
- Upload to Canvas by **February 24, 2025**.

## Python & Markdown for Documentation
Students are encouraged to use **Markdown** for documentation, especially those in **computer science**. Markdown is widely used for documentation, GitHub repositories, and note-taking.

**Basic Markdown Syntax:**
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

- Bullet points
- Another item

**Bold Text**
*Italic Text*

`Inline code` example

```python
# Code block example
print("Hello, World!")
` ` ` 
(note -- remove the space between the ticks)
```

### Screenshot Instructions
- Use the **Snipping Tool (Windows)** or **Command + Shift + 4 (Mac)** to take a screenshot.
- Save it and embed it in your documentation.
- Alternatively, **copy and paste** the program output if it is simple enough.

## Debugging & Testing
When testing your program, follow these steps:
1. **Test boundary values** (e.g., very low and very high weights).
2. **Check for errors** (e.g., what happens if the user inputs text instead of numbers?).
3. **Verify calculations manually** to ensure correctness.

If you encounter issues, please visit **office hours** or email for clarification. Using **ChatGPT or online resources** to assist with debugging is acceptable—just cite your sources.

### Final Notes
- **PieCharm Setup:** Ensure you have installed the **Educational Edition** for a free, student-friendly environment.
- **Markdown vs. Word:** Markdown is recommended for **computer science majors**, but Word is acceptable.
- **Office Hours:** No one is signed up yet—feel free to drop in for assistance!

We will continue with **additional programming concepts and debugging techniques** in the next session. Keep experimenting, and don’t hesitate to reach out for help!
