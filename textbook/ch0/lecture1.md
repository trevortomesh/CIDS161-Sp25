## **Course Goals**
This course aims to:
- Introduce you to computational thinking and programming fundamentals.
- Teach you how to write basic programs using Python.
- Familiarize you with command-line tools for running and testing programs.
- Develop skills in interpreting technical documentation and solving problems programmatically.

## **Why Python?**
Python is an excellent language for beginners because:
- It has a simple and readable syntax.
- It allows you to focus on problem-solving rather than complex syntax rules.
- It’s widely used in many industries, from data science to web development.

## **What to Expect**
- **Live Coding**: Lectures will focus on live coding rather than slides. This means I’ll program in real-time, make mistakes, and debug alongside you. This approach provides a more interactive and engaging learning experience.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Every lecture will include practice exercises to help you reinforce the concepts we discuss.
- **No Required Textbooks**: While reference materials will be suggested, all necessary content will be covered in lectures and available in the repository.

## **How This Course is Structured**
- **Assignments**: Three major programming projects designed to assess your understanding of key concepts.
- **Quizzes**: Five quizzes spread throughout the semester to test your knowledge.
- **Exams**: One midterm (in-person) and a final exam (online).
- **Practice Exercises**: Unofficial exercises will be provided after lectures to help you practice. These won’t be graded but are highly recommended.

## **Important Notes**
- **Class Code Repository**: All code examples written during lectures will be uploaded to the [class code repository](../../code).
- **Living Textbook**: This repository will serve as your primary reference, with transcribed notes and resources from each lecture.
- **Attendance**: While attendance isn’t mandatory, being present is strongly encouraged to make the most of live coding sessions and discussions.

## **Think About This**
1. **What is Computing?**  
   Computers perform billions of calculations per second. How do you think they decide *what* to calculate? What kinds of problems are computers uniquely good at solving, and what tasks might they struggle with?

2. **Programming Languages**  
   There are hundreds of programming languages, from Python to JavaScript to C++. Why do you think so many programming languages exist? What might make one language better than another for a specific task?

3. **Algorithms Everywhere**  
   Think about a simple task you do every day, like tying your shoes or making a sandwich. How would you explain it as a series of step-by-step instructions that a computer could follow? Could a computer ever "improvise" if you left out a step?

## **Closing Remarks**
This is just the beginning of your journey into computing. Stay engaged, ask questions, and practice consistently. If you have any concerns about the pace of the course, please let me know. I’m here to help!

Looking forward to seeing you all on Wednesday when we dive into Python programming!
