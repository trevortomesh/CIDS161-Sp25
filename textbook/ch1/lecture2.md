## Introduction

Welcome back to **CIDS 161**! Today, weâ€™re diving into the foundations of computingâ€”what computers are, what programs are, and how computing has evolved throughout history.

### ðŸ“– Textbook (Optional)
- **Introduction to Programming Using Python** by *Y. Daniel Liang*
- You **do not** need to purchase this book, but I will reference it throughout the course.

## **What is a Computer?**

To understand programming, we must first define what a **computer** actually is.

Think about it: almost everyone here has a computerâ€”whether itâ€™s a laptop, desktop, or even your smartphone (which is essentially a powerful computer in your pocket).

A **computer** is a device capable of processing information, following instructions, and performing computations.

---

## **What is a Program?**

A **program** is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.

Here are some student-suggested definitions of a program:
1. *"A line of code that does something."*
2. *"A series of tasks for a computer to perform."*

These definitions are close! Letâ€™s refine them:

> **A computer program is software that contains instructions that tell a computer what to do.**

Now, weâ€™ve introduced another key term: **software**.

---

## **Software vs. Hardware**

- **Hardware** = The **physical components** of a computer (*e.g., processor, memory, keyboard*).
- **Software** = The **digital instructions** that tell the hardware what to do.

### **Analogy**
- **Hardware** is like a **chef in a kitchen**.
- **Software** is like a **recipe**â€”it provides instructions for the chef to follow.

Now that we understand what computers and programs are, letâ€™s look at the **history of computing** and how it has evolved over time.

# **A Brief History of Computing**

## **Computers Before Machines: The Human Computers**

Did you know that before electronic computers, the word **"computer"** referred to a **person**?
- In the **1940s**, human "computers" (often women) were hired to perform **complex mathematical calculations**, particularly during **World War II**.

---

## **The Role of Computing in World War II**

Computing advanced significantly due to **codebreaking efforts** during WWII.

- The **Enigma Machine** was a **German encryption device** used to encode military communications.

- The Allies needed to **crack the code** to predict German movements.

---

## **Alan Turing and the Bombe Machine**

One of the most famous figures in computing history, **Alan Turing**, helped develop a device called the **Bombe**, which was used to break **Enigmaâ€™s encryption**.

  <img src="/textbook/assets/images/bombe.jpg" width="500"/>  

- Turingâ€™s work **shortened WWII** by an estimated **2-5 years** and saved millions of lives.
- This was a **major step** toward **modern computing**.

# **The Evolution of Computing Devices**

## **1. Early Computational Tools**

### **Tally Sticks (~50,000â€“12,000 BCE)**
- One of the earliest **mathematical tools**, used for **counting** and **record-keeping**.
- **Example**: The **Ishango Bone** (*Democratic Republic of Congo*), possibly the first **counting device**.

  <img src="/textbook/assets/images/bone.jpg" width="200"/>  

### **Abacus (~2,000 BCE)**
- An early **calculating tool** used to perform **addition** and **subtraction** quickly.
- Still used today in some regions!

  <img src="/textbook/assets/images/abacus.jpg" width="500"/>  

### **Calculi (Counting Stones) (~3,400 BCE - 3,000 BCE)**
- Used in **ancient Mesopotamia** to track **trade transactions**.
- Clay tokens represented quantities of goods and were stored in **sealed clay balls** to prevent fraud.

## **2. Mechanical Computers**

### **The Antikythera Mechanism (~100 BCE)**
- An **ancient Greek mechanical computer** used to predict **astronomical events**.
- Considered the **first analog computer**.

  <img src="/textbook/assets/images/am.jpg" width="500"/>  

### **Astrolabes (~150 BCE - 1600s CE)**
- Used by **sailors** to navigate using the **stars**.

  <img src="/textbook/assets/images/astrolabe.jpg" width="500"/>  

### **Slide Rule (1620s - 1970s)**
- A **mechanical tool** used for **multiplication, division, logarithms, and trigonometry**.
- Used by **engineers and scientists** before calculators existed!

## **3. The First Programmable Machines**

### **The Jacquard Loom (1804)**
- One of the **first programmable machines**, used for **weaving textiles**.
- Used **punch cards** to store and execute **patterns**.

  <img src="/textbook/assets/images/jl.jpg" width="300"/>  

### **Punch Cards (~1800s - 1980s)**
- Used to store **data** and program early **computers**.
- Found in early **voting systems, census data collection, and IBM mainframes**.

  <img src="/textbook/assets/images/pc.jpg" width="500"/>  

### **Charles Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine (~1837)**
- Considered the **first general-purpose programmable computer**.
- Designed but **never built** due to **lack of funding**.
- Introduced ideas like **memory storage** and an **arithmetic unit** (*which modern computers still use*).

# **Computing in the 20th Century**

### **Alan Turing and the Concept of Modern Computing**
- Turing introduced the idea of a **universal machine** that could **simulate any other machine** (*Turing Machine*).
- His work laid the foundation for **modern computers** and **artificial intelligence**.

### **Post-WWII Computing Advancements**
After WWII, computing evolved rapidly:
1. **1940s-1950s**: The first **electronic computers** (*e.g., ENIAC, UNIVAC*).
2. **1950s-1970s**: The rise of **mainframe computers** and early programming languages (*e.g., FORTRAN, COBOL*).
3. **1980s-1990s**: The **personal computer revolution** (*Apple, IBM, Microsoft*).
4. **2000s-Present**: The rise of **smartphones, AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing**.

# **Summary**

- **Computers** were originally **human mathematicians** before machines took over.
- **Early computing devices** (*tally sticks, abacuses, punch cards*) helped develop **modern computing**.
- The **Enigma Machine** & **Alan Turingâ€™s Bombe** played a major role in **WWII and early computer science**.
