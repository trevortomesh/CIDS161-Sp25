CIDS 161: Introduction to Computing

Lecture 2 - January 29, 2025

Introduction

Welcome back to CIDS 161! Today, we’re diving into the foundations of computing—what computers are, what programs are, and how computing has evolved throughout history. Before we begin, just a quick note about our textbook:
	•	Textbook (Optional): Introduction to Programming Using Python by Y. Daniel Liang
	•	You do not need to purchase this book, but I will reference it throughout the course.

Now, let’s start with a fundamental question:

What is a Computer?

To understand programming, we must first define what a computer actually is.

Think about it: almost everyone here has a computer—whether it’s a laptop, desktop, or even your smartphone (which is essentially a powerful computer in your pocket).

But what exactly is a computer? A computer is a device capable of processing information, following instructions, and performing computations.

To understand computers better, let’s define another key term:

What is a Program?

A program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.

Here are some student-suggested definitions of a program:
	1.	“A line of code that does something.”
	2.	“A series of tasks for a computer to perform.”

These definitions are close! Let’s refine them:

A computer program is software that contains instructions that tell a computer what to do.

Now, we’ve introduced another key term: software.

Software vs. Hardware
	•	Hardware = The physical components of a computer (e.g., processor, memory, keyboard).
	•	Software = The digital instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

Analogy:
	•	Hardware is like a chef in a kitchen.
	•	Software is like a recipe—it provides instructions for the chef to follow.

Now that we understand what computers and programs are, let’s look at the history of computing and how it has evolved over time.

A Brief History of Computing

Computers Before Machines: The Human Computers

Did you know that before electronic computers, the word “computer” referred to a person?
	•	In the 1940s, human “computers” (often women) were hired to perform complex mathematical calculations, particularly during World War II.

The Role of Computing in World War II

Computing advanced significantly due to codebreaking efforts during WWII.
	•	The Enigma Machine was a German encryption device used to encode military communications.

​	

•	The Allies needed to crack the code to predict German movements.

Alan Turing and the Bombe Machine

One of the most famous figures in computing history, Alan Turing, helped develop a device called the Bombe, which was used to break Enigma’s encryption.

​	•	Turing’s work shortened WWII by an estimated 2-5 years and saved millions of lives.
​	•	This was a major step toward modern computing.

The Evolution of Computing Devices

1. Early Computational Tools

Before modern computers, humans used various mechanical devices for calculations:

Tally Sticks (~50,000–12,000 BCE)
	•	One of the earliest mathematical tools, used for counting and record-keeping.
	•	Example: The Ishango Bone (Democratic Republic of Congo), possibly the first counting device.

Abacus (~2,000 BCE)
	•	An early calculating tool used to perform addition and subtraction quickly.
	•	Still used today in some regions!

Calculi (Counting Stones) (~3,400 BCE - 3,000 BCE)
	•	Used in ancient Mesopotamia to track trade transactions.
	•	Clay tokens represented quantities of goods and were stored in sealed clay balls to prevent fraud.

2. Mechanical Computers

As civilizations advanced, so did computing devices:

The Antikythera Mechanism (~100 BCE)
	•	An ancient Greek mechanical computer used to predict astronomical events.
	•	Considered the first analog computer.

Astrolabes (~150 BCE - 1600s CE)
	•	Used by sailors to navigate using the stars.

Slide Rule (1620s - 1970s)
	•	A mechanical tool used for multiplication, division, logarithms, and trigonometry.
	•	Used by engineers and scientists before calculators existed!

3. The First Programmable Machines

The Jacquard Loom (1804)
	•	One of the first programmable machines, used for weaving textiles.
	•	Used punch cards to store and execute patterns.

Punch Cards (~1800s - 1980s)
	•	Used to store data and program early computers.
	•	Found in early voting systems, census data collection, and IBM mainframes.

Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine (~1837)
	•	Considered the first general-purpose programmable computer.
	•	Designed but never built due to lack of funding.
	•	Introduced ideas like memory storage and an arithmetic unit (which modern computers still use).

Computing in the 20th Century

Alan Turing and the Concept of Modern Computing
	•	Turing introduced the idea of a universal machine that could simulate any other machine (Turing Machine).
	•	His work laid the foundation for modern computers and artificial intelligence.

Post-WWII Computing Advancements

After WWII, computing evolved rapidly:
	1.	1940s-1950s: The first electronic computers (e.g., ENIAC, UNIVAC).
	2.	1950s-1970s: The rise of mainframe computers and early programming languages (e.g., FORTRAN, COBOL).
	3.	1980s-1990s: The personal computer revolution (Apple, IBM, Microsoft).
	4.	2000s-Present: The development of smartphones, AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing.

Summary
	•	Computers were originally human mathematicians before machines took over.
	•	Early computing devices (tally sticks, abacuses, punch cards) helped develop modern computing.
	•	The Enigma Machine & Alan Turing’s Bombe played a major role in WWII and early computer science.
	•	Mechanical and early electronic computers paved the way for the digital revolution.
