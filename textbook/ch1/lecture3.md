# **CIDS 161: Introduction to Computing - Lecture Notes (January 31, 2025)**
## **The Histroy of Computer Science Pt. 2**

## **🔎 Understanding Computer Science**
CIDS 161 is designed to provide a broad overview of computer science as a discipline, along with an introduction to programming. In addition to learning to code, we explore:
- The history and evolution of computers
- Philosophical concepts of computing
- Key figures and milestones in computing history

## **📜 The Analytic Engine**
The **Analytic Engine**, conceptualized in **1837**, is considered the first true computer with **Turing completeness**.

- **Inventor:** Charles Babbage
- **Completion Status:** Never fully built due to engineering challenges and Babbage’s passing
- **Input:** Programs called *formulae*
- **Output:** A plotter (similar to a lie detector) and a bell
- **Storage Capacity:** ~16.6 KB (extremely limited by modern standards)
- **Mathematical Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparisons, square roots
- **Programming Language:** Similar to **assembly language**

💡 **Fun Fact:** The Analytic Engine could have potentially taken a program as input and outputted another program—a key concept in modern computing.

## **👩‍💻 Ada Lovelace: The First Programmer?**
Ada Lovelace, daughter of poet **Lord Byron**, is often credited as the **first computer programmer**. However, there is debate about this claim:

- In **1840**, Charles Babbage presented a lecture about his engine.
- Italian engineer **Luigi Menabrea** published lecture notes in French.
- Ada **translated** these notes into English and added an appendix containing an algorithm for computing *Bernoulli numbers*.
- Some believe **Babbage originally designed this algorithm** based on newly discovered manuscripts from **2015**.

Regardless of authorship, Ada Lovelace contributed significantly to the development of computer science and computational mathematics.

## **📊 Early Computing Innovations**
### **🔢 Logarithms and Early Calculators**
- **John Napier (17th century)**: Discovered **logarithms**, improving calculations.
- **Pascal’s Calculator (1600s)**: Could perform **addition and subtraction**.
- **Gottfried Leibniz**: Developed **Leibniz’s notation** for **calculus** and early mechanical computers.

### **🧮 Boolean Algebra**
- **George Boole (1854)**: Developed **Boolean algebra**, the foundation of logical operations in computing.

## **💡 The Birth of Electronic Computing**
### **🔌 Vacuum Tubes (1906)**
- Allowed computers to process logical operations electronically.
- Used in early computers such as **Colossus** (World War II era).
- Vacuum tube computers were **large, expensive, and single-purpose**.

### **🖥️ Universal Computation: Alan Turing**
- **Alan Turing (1936)**: Introduced the concept of **Turing machines**.
- **Turing Machines**:
    - Hypothetical machines with **an infinitely long tape**.
    - Read, write, erase, and rewrite data.
    - Could theoretically compute **any computable sequence**.

💡 **Key Idea:** A **Turing-complete** machine can execute any program, including an emulation of itself.

**Modern Examples:**
- **Emulators**: Running **Windows on Mac**, playing **Game Boy games** on a PC.
- **Virtual Machines**: Running **an operating system within another OS**.

## **📡 Claude Shannon and Information Theory**
- **Claude Shannon (1948)**: Defined **the bit (binary digit)** as the fundamental unit of information.
- **Information Theory**: The study of **quantification, storage, and transmission of information**.

### **🤔 Discussion Question:**
**How can information be represented using only 1s and 0s?**  
(We’ll explore this in the next lecture!)
