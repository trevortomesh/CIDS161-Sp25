# Introduction to Computers – CIDS 161

## What is a Computer?
A **computer** is a device that **stores and processes information**. The book definition states that a computer is an *electronic device that stores and processes data*, but this definition can be expanded.

### Components of a Computer
A computer consists of several key components:
- **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The "brain" of the computer that performs operations.
- **Input Devices**: Devices like a keyboard, mouse, microphone, and camera that allow users to enter data.
- **Output Devices**: Devices like a monitor, headphones, and printer that display or output processed data.
- **Memory**: There are two main types:
  - **RAM (Random Access Memory)** – temporary, volatile storage.
  - **Storage (Hard Drives, SSDs, CDs/DVDs)** – long-term, non-volatile storage.
- **Communication Devices**: Network cards, modems, and Wi-Fi adapters that allow computers to connect to the internet and other systems.

### The Role of the CPU
The **CPU** is responsible for executing instructions and making decisions. It consists of millions (or even billions) of **transistors**, which are tiny electronic switches that turn on and off to process binary data (1s and 0s).

Computers operate in terms of **Hertz (Hz)**, which measures how many operations a processor can perform per second. Modern computers operate in **gigahertz (GHz)**, performing billions of operations per second.

## Bits, Bytes, and Memory
### Binary Representation
Computers use **binary (base-2)**, which consists of only two states: **0 and 1**. All information—numbers, letters, and symbols—is represented in binary.

Example:
- The uppercase letter **C** is represented in binary as `01000011`.
- The number **3** in binary is `00000011`.

Each **bit** (binary digit) can be either 0 or 1. A **byte** is a group of 8 bits and can store one character of text.

### How Data is Stored
Memory in a computer consists of ordered sequences of bits and bytes stored in locations called **memory addresses**. Data in RAM is stored temporarily and lost when the power is turned off, while data in storage devices like hard drives and SSDs is persistent.

## Storage Devices
There are multiple types of storage devices:
1. **RAM (Random Access Memory)** – Fast, temporary, volatile memory used while a program is running.
2. **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)** – Uses spinning magnetic platters and a read/write head.
3. **SSD (Solid State Drive)** – Faster than HDDs, with no moving parts.
4. **CD/DVD (Compact Disc/Digital Versatile Disc)** – Uses a laser to read/write data permanently.
5. **Flash Drives** – USB-based portable storage using solid-state technology.

### Volatile vs. Non-Volatile Memory
- **Volatile memory** (RAM): Loses data when power is turned off.
- **Non-volatile memory** (Storage): Retains data even when power is off.

## Introduction to Programming
A **programming language** is a way to communicate with a computer using structured instructions.

Popular programming languages include:
- **Python** (which we will use in this course)
- **Java**
- **C and C++**
- **JavaScript**
- **Assembly (Low-Level Language)**

### Python
Python is a **high-level programming language** that is widely used due to its readability and ease of use.

Before next class:
- **Download and install PyCharm Education Edition**
- Familiarize yourself with the interface
- Be ready to write your first Python program!
